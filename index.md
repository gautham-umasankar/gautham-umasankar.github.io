## Hi! I'm Gautham
I am an applied physicist and electrical engineer. I love modeling the world and engineering powerful systems. My main research interest is in superconducting circuits for quantum information processing. I am currently pursuing my dual degree in Quantum Science and Electrical Engineering at IIT Madras.
