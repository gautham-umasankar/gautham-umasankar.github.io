# Music
I am a professional violinist in Carnatic music, a traditional artform in Southern India. I have performed in 8-10 professional concerts in the city of Chennai. I have been learning this artform for 15 years, and have assisted my teacher with teaching his students. I have won accolades in cultural fests conducted by other IITs and universities in India. 

I have also trained as a vocalist in Carnatic music for 10 years. I love to sing occasionally and I am trying to develop this skill.

I pride myself on my ability to whistle Carnatic music, a talent I developed by whiling away idle hours in my middle school. 

I was the head of the Classical Arts Club at IIT Madras, where I got to organise 7-10 concerts and 4 events spread throghout the year. I had a wonderful experience leading a team and interacting with leading artists in the field.

# Volunteering

In my first year of undergraduate study at IIT Madras, I worked in an NGO called Avanti. We mentored under-privileged students in their attempts to qualify JEE Advanced, the entrance exam to premier universities in India. I rediscovered my love for teaching and found meaning in helping others with my talents.

# Spirituality and Indian Culture

**"You are only entitled to the action, never to its fruits. Do not let the fruits of your action be your motive" - The Bhagavad Gita**

This quote has inspired me to dedicate myself to my pursuits and habits and find satisfaction in perpetual growth as opposed to pursuing an ever-shifting horizon and goals.
I have always been curious about the ways of thinking of the ancients. Having grown up in an orthodox and traditional family, I was constantly exposed to ancient Vedic texts and schools of thought. I am pursuing this interest by learning the Vedas (Ancient Indian Compendiums of Knowledge) for the past 10 years, learning Sanskrit and listening to lecture series on the Bhagavad Gita.

I have found nuggets of wisdom in these pursuits which have stabilized my personal and professional life.
